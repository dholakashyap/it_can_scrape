# Web Scraper API Documentation

## Overview

The Web Scraper API is a tool that enables users to extract data from various e-commerce websites. It provides a simple interface for developers to programmatically scrape product information from these websites and use it in their applications.

## API Endpoints

### Scrape Product Data

- **Endpoint**: `/scrape`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Parameters**:
  - `url` (string): The URL of the e-commerce product page to scrape.
- **Response**:
  - HTTP status codes indicating success or failure.
  - JSON format containing scraped product data, including product name, price, description, and product images.

## Usage

To initiate a data scraping process, send a POST request to the `/scrape` endpoint with the URL of the e-commerce product page you want to scrape.

The API will fetch the webpage, extract the relevant product information, and structure it into a JSON response.

The JSON response containing the scraped data can then be used in your application.

## Error Handling

The API handles errors gracefully, providing meaningful error responses when the scraping process encounters issues or receives invalid requests. Refer to the `error_handler.py` file for more details on error handling.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The API provides reasonably fast response times, allowing developers to retrieve scraped data promptly.
- **Security**: The API implements proper security measures to prevent abuse and protect user data.

## Future Enhancements

While the initial version of the Web Scraper API focuses on scraping basic product information, there are potential enhancements for future versions:

- **Extended Website Support**: Continuously expand the number of supported e-commerce websites.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests from a single user or IP address.

For more details on the implementation, refer to the respective Python files in the `web_scraper_api` directory.
