# Advanced Web Scraper API Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the Advanced Web Scraper API, a powerful tool for extracting product data from various e-commerce websites.

## Features

### Comprehensive Data Extraction

The API is designed to extract a wide range of product data from e-commerce websites, including:

- Product Name
- Product Price
- Product Description
- Customer Reviews
- Product Ratings
- Product Availability

### Flexible Output Options

The API allows developers to specify which data fields they want to extract for each product, offering flexibility in the output data.

### Support for Pagination

The API supports pagination, enabling it to extract data from all product pages, not just the first one.

### Asynchronous Scraping

The API uses asynchronous scraping to handle multiple requests concurrently, improving the efficiency of data extraction.

### User-Friendly Parameters

The API uses clear and intuitive parameter names, such as `url`, `fields`, and `pagination`, making it easy for developers to interact with the API.

### Advanced Error Handling

The API provides detailed error messages with error codes to help developers troubleshoot and understand any issues that may occur during the scraping process.

### Caching Mechanism

The API uses a caching mechanism to temporarily store the scraped data, improving performance and reducing redundant requests.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

The API implements rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the frequency of requests and prevent overloading the target websites' resources.

## User Flow

1. Developers interact with the API by sending HTTP POST requests.
2. The main API endpoint for scraping product data is `/scrape`.
3. In the request body, the developer needs to provide the following parameters:
   - `url`: The URL of the e-commerce product page to scrape.
   - `fields` (Optional): An array of data fields to be extracted.
   - `pagination` (Optional): Enable pagination for websites with multiple product pages.
4. The API responds with a JSON object containing the scraped product data.

## API Endpoints

### Scrape Product Data

- Endpoint: `/scrape`
- Method: POST
- Request Parameters:
  - `url`: The URL of the e-commerce product page to scrape.
  - `fields` (Optional): An array of data fields to be extracted.
  - `pagination` (Optional): Enable pagination for websites with multiple product pages.
- Response: JSON format containing scraped product data.

## Deployment

The Advanced Web Scraper API should be deployed on a web server accessible through the internet. Various hosting options like Heroku, Netlify, or AWS can be used to deploy the API.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: The API is designed to handle a higher number of concurrent requests efficiently.
- Performance Optimization: The API is optimized to reduce response times and enhance overall performance.
- Documentation Enhancement: This document provides comprehensive information about all features, parameters, and usage instructions of the API.

## Future Enhancements

- Machine Learning-based Extraction: Future versions of the API may implement machine learning techniques to extract product data from unstructured webpages.
- Customized Headers: Future versions of the API may allow users to provide custom headers for requests to bypass anti-scraping mechanisms.
