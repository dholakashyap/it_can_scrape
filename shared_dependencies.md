Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schemas**: The data schemas that are shared across the files include `Product` and `Review`. These schemas define the structure of the product and review data that will be scraped from the e-commerce websites.

2. **Function Names**: The function names that are shared across the files include `scrape`, `handle_pagination`, `async_scrape`, `handle_error`, `cache_data`, and `rate_limit`. These functions are used to implement the various features of the API.

3. **API Endpoint**: The API endpoint `/scrape` is shared across the files. This is the main endpoint that developers will interact with to scrape product data.

4. **Request Parameters**: The request parameters `url`, `fields`, and `pagination` are shared across the files. These parameters are used to specify the e-commerce product page to scrape and the data fields to extract.

5. **HTTP Methods**: The HTTP method POST is shared across the files. This method is used to send data in the HTTP request body.

6. **Error Codes**: The error codes are shared across the files for advanced error handling. These codes help developers troubleshoot and understand any issues that occur during the scraping process.

7. **Rate Limiting Mechanism**: The rate limiting mechanism is shared across the files to control the frequency of requests made by the API.

8. **Caching Mechanism**: The caching mechanism is shared across the files to temporarily store the scraped data and improve performance.

9. **Test Names**: The test names `test_scraper`, `test_pagination`, `test_async_scraping`, `test_error_handling`, `test_caching`, `test_rate_limiting`, and `test_scrape_route` are shared across the test files. These tests are used to verify the functionality of the API.

10. **Documentation**: The API documentation is shared across the files to provide comprehensive information about all features, parameters, and usage instructions of the API.
