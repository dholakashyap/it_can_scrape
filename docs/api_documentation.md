# Advanced Web Scraper API Documentation

## Overview

The Advanced Web Scraper API is a powerful tool designed to extract comprehensive product data from various e-commerce websites. This API is capable of scraping data from sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Coles, Woolworths, and many more.

## Features

### Comprehensive Data Extraction

The API is designed to extract a wide range of product data, including:

- Product Name
- Product Price
- Product Description
- Customer Reviews
- Product Ratings
- Product Availability
- Product Images

### Flexible Output Options

The API provides flexibility in the output data, allowing developers to specify which data fields they want to extract for each product.

### Support for Pagination

The API supports pagination, enabling it to extract data from all product pages, not just the first one.

### Asynchronous Scraping

The API uses asynchronous scraping to handle multiple requests concurrently, reducing the time it takes to fetch and extract data from various websites.

### User-Friendly Parameters

The API uses clear and intuitive names for the parameters, such as `url`, `fields`, `pagination`, and `async`.

### Advanced Error Handling

The API provides detailed error messages with error codes to help developers troubleshoot and understand any issues that may occur during the scraping process.

### Caching Mechanism

The API uses a caching mechanism to temporarily store the scraped data, reducing the need to repeat the scraping process for the same data.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

The API implements rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the frequency of requests made by the API.

## API Endpoint

The primary API endpoint for scraping product data is `/scrape`.

### Request Parameters

- `url` (string): The URL of the e-commerce product page to scrape.
- `fields` (array) [Optional]: An array of data fields to be extracted.
- `pagination` (boolean) [Optional]: Enable pagination for websites with multiple product pages.
- `async` (boolean) [Optional]: Enable asynchronous scraping for faster extraction.

### Response

The API responds with a JSON object containing the scraped product data, based on the specified URL and parameters.

## Deployment

The Advanced Web Scraper API should be deployed on a web server accessible through the internet. Hosting options include Heroku, Netlify, or AWS.

## Future Enhancements

Future versions of the Advanced Web Scraper API may include:

- Machine Learning-based Extraction: Implement machine learning techniques to extract product data from unstructured webpages.
- Customized Headers: Allow users to provide custom headers for requests to bypass anti-scraping mechanisms.
